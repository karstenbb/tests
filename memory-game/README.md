#  Memory game

We would like for you to implement the [Memory game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)). This is a card game where pairs of cards contain images, such that for each card, there is exactly one other card with the same image. The cards are placed face-down on a surface. A player chooses any two cards and flips them face-up. If they happen to have the same image, they will stay face-up — otherwise they should be flipped back. This continues until all cards are face-up.

You are free to implement this however you see fit, but please do not use any frameworks or non-utility libraries (by utility libraries we mean libraries such as lodash, rambda, underscore, etc). We expect you to spend no more than 3 hours on the task (this is both to not put too much work on you, and so we'll get to it all in the course of our interview).

Please keep in mind that we might want to extend this game later on (maybe even during the interview), and that we'd like to see the kind of code you'd write in our team, so think about the readability and structure of your code.

There are a lot of areas you could choose to focus on in this game, for instance:

* Finding awesome cat, ninja or catninja pictures to put on the cards. Static or dynamic?
* Does a player get points? Is there timing involved? A scoreboard?
* Single-player? Local multi-player? Networked multi-player?
* Accessibility?
* Responsive design that works for mobile and desktop?

You'll probably end up spending more than 3 hours if you try to do it all, though, so we advise that you choose just a few.

It's helpful if you document your game and explain some of the decisions or assumptions you've made. Given the time constraint, please feel free to note the things you'd have liked to do next, too.

We have created a starter kit project to help you with boilerplate. It includes babel, sass, webpack and webpack-dev-server. There is also a directory called ‘example-image-server’, which contains — yes! An example image server. So if you prefer a super-simple (and local) way to get images for your cards, you can use that. You can find this starter kit attached in this email. **Using the starter kit is completely optional though, so feel free to either use all of it, some of it or none at all.**

Don't hesitate to get in touch with us at any time throughout this task if you have any questions. We realise and appreciate that you’re taking personal time out to complete this task, so we’re happy to help.
